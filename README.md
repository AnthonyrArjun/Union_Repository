# Union_Repository
First Try Fridays 

Hello World. I am Anthony. I like to skateboard, play video games, and race cars (one day hopefully). 
Hopefully I can get good at coding, and land a job utilizing the languages I learn. 

UPDATE: I have successfully learned MySQL and Python since last visiting this repository. I hope to understand the fundamentals of the Django framework soon, so I can further enhance my knowledge in the Python language.
